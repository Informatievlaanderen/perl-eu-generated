Even within countries, there are almost always examples of Addresses that do not conform to the stated national standard. At the time of publication, work is progressing on <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/61710.html\">ISO 19160-1</a> that defines a method through which different Addresses can be converted from one conceptual model to another.\r\n</p></br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis specification was heavily based on the INSPIRE Address Representation data type. It is noteworthy that if an Address is provided using the detailed breakdown suggested by the properties for this class, then it will be INSPIRE-conformant. To this very granular set of\r\nproperties, we add two further properties:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>- full address (the complete address as a formatted string)</li>\r\n  <li>- addressID (a unique identifier for the address)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe first of these allows publishers to simply provide the complete Address as one string, with or without formatting. This is analogous to <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#label\">vCard's label property</a>.\r\n</p></br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe addressID is part of the INSPIRE guidelines and provides a hook that can be used to link the Address to an alternative representation, such as vCard or OASIS xAL.\r\n</p>",

Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once. In this case, however, the granular name elements should not be used since the intention is that these provide a breakdown of the full name and it will not be clear of which full name this is true. \nNote that the vocabulary provides an alternative name property. This allows name(s) to be recorded that have no legal status but that nevertheless are the names by which an individual is generally known.\r\n</p></br>\r\n<p>\r\n\nA name usually sticks with a person for a long time period. In some European countries a name may only be changed according to certain laws and life events, e.g. marriage. The name denominates a natural person even if he/she changes their address. Documents like birth certificate or diploma usually don't carry an address but always the name. Thus the name is one of the core attributes. However it is not sufficient to identify a person since there are combinations of very common names like Smith in the UK, Meier in Germany, or Li in China.\r\n</p>",
